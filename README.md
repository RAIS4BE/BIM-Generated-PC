# BIM-Generated-PC
This dataset comprises 3D point clouds generated from a BIM model since 2023 on the National University of Singapore campus. The scenes include both structural components and architectural elements. The dataset has been utilised to train a domain adaptation network (DawNet) for semantic segmentation. Data collection and processing were carried out by Difeng Hu and Vincent Gan, with results published in Automation in Construction (doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2024.105473).
